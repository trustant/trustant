# Build Scripts

`build.sh` is the compatibility entrypoint for building the Trustable image.

Modes:

- `TRUSTABLE_BUILD_MODE=auto` (default): use the macOS Trustable VM flow when
  `~/Library/Application Support/Trustable/id_ed25519` and `current.ip` exist;
  otherwise delegate to `build-server.sh`.
- `TRUSTABLE_BUILD_MODE=mac`: require the macOS Trustable VM files and use the
  SSH/import/deploy flow.
- `TRUSTABLE_BUILD_MODE=server`: run the Linux/k3s server flow directly.

`build-server.sh` is for running on the Trustable k3s server. It builds the Go
binary for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, builds the Docker image through
`image/image.sh`, imports the image into local k3s containerd with
`docker save ... | sudo -n k3s ctr images import -`, then patches
`StatefulSet/trustable` in namespace `nuvolaris`.

`image/image.sh` builds the base image from the part of `image/Dockerfile`
before the `###---###` separator. The base image installs
`openserverless-mcp` from the repository `mcp` submodule, not from a direct
GitHub npm reference. Before building, the script stages the submodule into the
Docker build context as `image/openserverless-mcp`, and the base-image hash
must include both the base Dockerfile and the current `mcp` submodule commit.
This guarantees that updating the MCP submodule pointer rebuilds the base image
used by Trustable.

Server build environment:

- `TRUSTABLE_IMAGE`: image repository, default
  `ghcr.io/trustable-ai/trustable-app`.
- `TRUSTABLE_BUILD_TAG`: explicit image tag. If omitted, the tag is
  `<key>_<version>_<yy.jjj.HHMM>`.
- `TRUSTABLE_BUILD_SKIP_DEPLOY=1`: build the image but do not require local
  k3s/kubectl access, import the image, or patch k3s.
- `TRUSTABLE_K8S_NAMESPACE`: namespace, default `nuvolaris`.
- `TRUSTABLE_K8S_STATEFULSET`: StatefulSet name, default `trustable`.
- `TRUSTABLE_K8S_CONTAINER`: container name, default `trustable`.
- `TRUSTABLE_K8S_ROLLOUT_TIMEOUT`: rollout timeout, default `300s`.

The server flow does not update `olaris-bestia/opsroot.json`; that file belongs
to the release/plugin publishing flow. Local server builds are for testing the
image currently being developed.
